Fundamental Enterprise Applications Building Blocks. 

Being inspired and based on Spring goal of this project is to provide simple building blocks you might need when developing real world enterprise applications. As of now building blocks list identified as:
* Internationalization
* Validation
* Authentication & Authorization
* Simple email sender
* Typical implementation for C.R.U.D. operations
 * Data Access Layer
 * Service Layer
 * Validation
 * Authorization
 * Spriong MVC controller
 * UI piece (server pages + javascript)

Initial codebase is donated by me from my (Sergey Karpushin) hobby project for efforts tracking (www.eftracker.ru). I see this as very common to any other enterprise project I'm going to build in future. So why not share it, maybe someone else will make use of it.

This project *DOES NOT* claim to be the one and the only right way to implemente mentioned pieces for enterprise application appliance. Still I tried to design it in a way so it will be easy to substitute any part of it with your own implementation to make whole thing work.
